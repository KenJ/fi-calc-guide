# About

FI Calc is a calculator that helps you plan for retirement.

The goal of FI Calc is to provide all of the features one might need when creating their retirement plan
using historical data and Monte Carlo simulations.

### History

I created FI Calc in 2018 to be a mobile-first retirement simulator. The first version didn't have many features, and
it was ultimately stashed away in my virtual drawer of unfinished side projects. In 2020 I had a
sudden burst of motivation to start work on it again, and the result of that is the application that you see today.

### Technology

FI Calc is a client-side React application. There is no server; all calculations are performed in the browser.

You can view the source of FI Calc [on GitHub](https://github.com/jamesplease/fi-calc).
