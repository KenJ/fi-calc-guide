Withdrawals</h3><p>Withdrawals are annual, and they are made at the very beginning of the year. Making a withdrawal is the very first thing to occur in a simulation year.</p><p>If additional income or additional withdrawals are specified, then they also occur at the start of the year alongside the &quot;base&quot; withdrawal.</p><p>Although not exact (due to the specific of the Shiller data set), it is reasonable to think of the withdrawals as being made on January 1st of each year.</p><h3>2. Fees, Growth, and Dividends</h3><p>Fees, growth, and dividends are each individually calculated a single time at the very end of the year. They are each based on the value of your assets after the withdrawal has been made.</p><p>You can consider these values to be calculated on the final day of each simulation year, December 31st.</p><h3>3. Portfolio Rebalancing</h3><p>Portfolio rebalancing, when specified, is the final step of each simulation year.</p><p>You can consider these values to be calculated on the final day of each simulation year, December 31st.</p><h2>Example</h2><p>This example will step through a year using Shiller's data set to illustrate with numbers how the above algorithm plays out.</p></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer_content">Â© 2020 FI Calc.<ul class="footer_linkList"><li class="footer_linkListItem"><a href="/about" class="footer_link">About</a></li><li class="footer_linkListItem"><a href="/contact" class="footer_link">Contact</a></li><li class="footer_linkListItem"><a href="https://github.com/jamesplease/fi-calc" class="footer_link">GitHub</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></div></div><script>var isLightMode=window.matchMedia&&window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: light)").matches,bodyClass=isLightMode?"lightMode":"darkMode";document.body.classList.add(bodyClass);var logo=document.querySelector(".home_titleImg");logo&&isLightMode&&(logo.src="/fi-calc-logo-light.png");var nav=document.querySelector(".nav"),navTop=sessionStorage.getItem("nav-scroll");null!==navTop&&(nav.scrollTop=parseInt(navTop,10)),window.addEventListener("beforeunload",function(){sessionStorage.setItem("nav-scroll",nav.scrollTop)});</script></body></html>
