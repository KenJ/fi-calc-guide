Most<br>people wish to withdraw as much as they can to maximize their quality of<br>life, but not so much that they run out of money.</p><p>It's impossible to know with certainty how much we can safely withdraw<br>each year, because we can't know how the market will perform during your<br>retirement, nor how long we will live. But there are ways to make an<br>informed decision.</p><h2>Finding a Safe Withdrawal Rate</h2><p>In the early 90's, a financial advisor named William Bengen came up with<br>a novel idea to determine a safe withdrawal rate: simulating retirements<br>using historical data. He took a retirement plan and calculated how it<br>would have performed if an individual had started their retirement in 1926.<br>After some number of years (he used 30 in his study), he<br>determined if there was any money left in the portfolio. Then, he ran<br>the simulation again, starting in the year 1927, and continued all the<br>way through the present day.</p><p>After running all of the simulations, he determined that retirement<br>plans survived about 95% of the time with a 4% initial withdrawal rate.<br>After the first year, you adjust the withdrawal amount for inflation to<br>ensure that your purchasing power remains about the same.</p><p>A few years after Bengen's study, a group of professors reconfirmed his<br>results in a paper called The Trinity Study. This idea is now known as<br>The 4% Rule, and it remains a foundational idea in retirement planning<br>even today.</p><p>This method of determing a safe withdrawal strategy is powerful if you<br>believe that the market during your retirement will perform no worse<br>than the worst market in the available data set.</p><h2>Other Withdrawal Strategies</h2><p>In the time since the 4% Rule was originally conceived, new withdrawal<br>strategies have been created that offer pros and cons compared to The 4%<br>Rule.</p><p>What other strategies exist, and which one is most appropriate for you?<br>You can use FI Calc to find these answers.</p><h2>Using FI Calc</h2><p>This calculator allows you to run your retirement simulations using<br>historical data, just like Bengen. You can recreate his original<br>results, or tweak the inputs to discover new results. Run retirements<br>that are shorter or longer, or that withdraw less or more, and see how<br>these changes impact success rates.</p><p>In addition to the withdrawal strategy used in The 4% Rule, FI Calc<br>includes others that you can use, too, and those strategies are just as<br>configurable. You can export your results as a CSV file and continue<br>your calculations in your spreadsheet app of choice.</p><p>You're now ready to jump in and start running simulations – have fun!</p><div class="page_ctas"><a href="https://ficalc.app/calculator" class="button page_ctaBtn">Launch Calculator</a></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer_content">© 2020 FI Calc.<ul class="footer_linkList"><li class="footer_linkListItem"><a href="/about" class="footer_link">About</a></li><li class="footer_linkListItem"><a href="/contact" class="footer_link">Contact</a></li><li class="footer_linkListItem"><a href="https://github.com/jamesplease/fi-calc" class="footer_link">GitHub</a></li></ul></div></footer></div></div></div></body></html>
