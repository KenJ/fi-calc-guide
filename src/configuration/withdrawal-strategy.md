# Withdrawal Strategy

Each year of your retirement, you must decide how much you will withdraw from
your portfolio. Most people wish to withdraw the most that they can to maximize
their quality of life, but not so much that they run out of money before the end
of their retirement.

Different people have devised withdrawal strategies that each have different
goals and different behaviors based on how the market is doing.

This is a deep topic, and we are working on a guide that describes all of the
different withdrawal strategies in detail. Check back soon.
