# Initial Portfolio

Your portfolio is the collection of assets that you own, including equities
(stocks), cash, real estate, and so on. When simulating your retirement plan
using FI Calc, you specify the portfolio that you have, or plan to have, at the
start of your retirement.

Presently, FI Calc supports two kinds of assets: equities and bonds. More asset
types will be added in the future.

## Deciding on a Portfolio Value

If you're not sure how much to enter, begin by running simulations with the
default value, \$1,000,000. Experiment with the different withdrawal strategies
to see how the withdrawal amounts compare to what you think you might need
during retirement. From there, you can adjust the initial portfolio to find a
value that feels right for you.

## Entering Asset Types

### Equities

There is a single input field for all of your equities. If you have different
kinds of stock investments, then you should add all of their values together and
input the sum here.

Additionally, you can also specify the annual fees, or expense ratio, for your
stocks. Once again, we recommend inputting the average fees of your investments.

### Bonds

Similarly to stocks, there is a single input field for all of your bonds. Add up
the value of all of your bond investments and place them in this field.

## Rebalancing Your Portfolio

By default, FI Calc ensures that your portfolio's asset allocation remains
constant over time. You may disable this by unchecking the "Rebalance portfolio
annually" checkbox.

In the future, FI Calc will support "glide path" allocations, where your asset
allocation changes over time. However, this is not currently an option.
