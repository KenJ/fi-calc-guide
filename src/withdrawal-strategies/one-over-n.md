# 1/N

The 1/N strategy is a straightforward rule that determines your yearly
withdrawal with the equation:

$$
withdrawal = \frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle portfolioValue}
$$

For example, if you estimate a 30 year retirement and start with \$1,000,000,
then your first year withdrawal will be `$1,000,000 / 30`, or `$33,333.33`.

Later on, if we assume that you have \$250,000 in your portfolio with 2 years
remaining, then your annual withdrawal would be `$250,000 / 2`, or `$125,000`.

### Strengths

- Ensures that you spend every available dollar
- Never prematurely runs out of money

### Weaknesses

- Tends to spend more money toward the end of your retirement than at the
  beginning.
