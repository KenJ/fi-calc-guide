# Dynamic SWR

The Dynamic SWR method was created by James Jones from
[Nesteggly](https://www.nesteggly.com/). He came up with a novel approach to
determining annual withdrawals: consider that you're writing yourself an
inflation-adjusted annuity funded by your retirement savings.

The result of this is a strategy that shares many similarities to the
[VPW strategy](../vpw). If the Maximize Spending strategies appeal to you, then
it may be worth comparing VPW and Dynamic SWR to see which one makes the most
sense to you.

### Strengths

- Adapts to market conditions, ensuring your portfolio never runs out of money
  prematurely
- Ensures that you spend as much money as possible during your retirement

### Weaknesses

- Withdrawal amounts can vary considerably based on market conditions
- Following the algorithm toward the end of your estimated retirement may create
  problems. We can never know how long we will actually live.
