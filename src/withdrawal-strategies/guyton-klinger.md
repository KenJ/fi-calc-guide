# Guyton-Klinger

Guyton-Klinger is a withdrawal strategy that aims to maximize portfolio
longevity. You can think of it as a modified
[Constant Dollar strategy](../constant-dollar).

What makes Guyton-Klinger different from Constant Dollar are what are called the
three Decision Rules. These rules adjust how much you withdraw each year based
on how the market is performing, and how much money remains in your portfolio.

One of the rules determines whether or not you should adjust your withdrawal
rate for inflation in a given year. The other two rules increase or decrease
your withdrawal based on the health of your portfolio.

Because of these Decision Rules, Guyton-Klinger is one of the most complicated
withdrawal strategies.

### Strengths

- It responds to market conditions, increasing risk of success by reducing
  spending when the market is performing poorly and increasing spending when the
  market does well.
- It responds smoothly to market conditions, so that year-after-year changes to
  your withdrawal are small, unlike the Percentage of Portfolio strategy
- It has a low likelihood of exhausting your portfolio, even over long
  retirement lengths.

### Weaknesses

- Like all withdrawal strategies that vary based on market conditions, annual
  withdrawals can become too low without a minimum withdrawal in place.
- The Decision Rules make calculating yearly withdrawals quite complex.
