# Constant Dollar

The Constant Dollar is one of – if not the most – well-known withdrawal
strategies. That's because it's the strategy used in the studies that derived
The 4% Rule.

### Strengths

- It ensures that your quality of life stays consistent, as it adjusts annual
  withdrawals for inflation
- Reasonably high rate of success (depending on asset allocation, length of
  retirement, and initial withdrawal percent)

### Weaknesses

- Spending is not reduced when the economy is doing poorly, increasing
  likelihood of running out of money
- Spending is not increased when the economy is doing well, so you can sometimes
  end your retirement with a considerable amount of money
