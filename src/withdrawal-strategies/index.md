# Withdrawal Strategies

The amount that you choose to withdraw from your portfolio on a given year is
determined by your **withdrawal strategy**. A withdrawal strategy is an
algorithm that may factor in things like how much you spent last year and the
current value of your portfolio to determine your current withdrawal amount.

FI Calc includes some of the most popular withdrawal strategies for you to
explore, and it groups the strategies into three groups based on their
similarities.

### Basic Strategies

The word "basic" refers to the simplicity of the algorithms in this category.

Although each of these strategies has drawbacks, studying them can be beneficial
because the strategies in the other categories draw inspiration from them.

In this category, the Constant Dollar strategy is particularly noteworthy
because it is the strategy used in the well-known 4% Rule studies.

- [Percent of Portfolio](./percent-of-portfolio)
- [1/N](./one-over-n)

### Maximize Spending

These strategies aim to maximize how much you spend over the course of your
retirement.

A common feature between these strategies is that they completely deplete your
portfolio in the final year of the specified retirement length, while also
guaranteeing that you never run out before that final year.

If leaving a sizable legacy behind is not a concern of yours, then these
strategies may appeal to you.

- [Custom VPW](./custom-vpw)
- [Dynamic Safe Withdrawal Rate (Dynamic SWR)](./dynamic-swr)

### Maximize Longevity

Strategies in this category are designed to last a very long time, perhaps
indefinitely. Two of the ways that these strategies accomplish this is by
reducing withdrawals during economic downturns and also by ensuring that your
withdrawals never rise too high above the initial amount specified.

These strategies may interest you if you wish to leave a legacy behind.
