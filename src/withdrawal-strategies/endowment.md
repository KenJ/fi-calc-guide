# Endowment Strategy

The Endowment Strategy is used by Yale University to determine its annual
spending of its endowment. It was developed by a team of Yale's economic
professors working with the University's endowment officials.

### Strengths

- It responds to market conditions, increasing risk of success by reducing
  spending when the market is performing poorly and increasing spending when the
  market does well.
- It responds smoothly to market conditions, so that year-after-year changes to
  your withdrawal are small, unlike the Percentage of Portfolio strategy
- It has a low likelihood of exhausting your portfolio, even over long
  retirement lengths.
- It's algorithm is straightforward enough to calculate annual withdrawals by
  hand

### Weaknesses

- Like all withdrawal strategies that vary based on market conditions, annual
  withdrawals can become too low without a minimum withdrawal in place.
