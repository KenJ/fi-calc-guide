# 95% Rule

The 95% Rule is a withdrawal strategy with a unique priority: it aims to
preserve your initial portfolio value for the entire duration of your
retirement. Other withdrawal strategies typically only care about having a
nonzero amount of money remaining at the end of the estimated retirement.

Using the 95% Rule, your annual withdrawals are based off of percentages, and as
a result this strategy will _never_ completely exhaust your portfolio. Unlike
the [Percent of Portfolio strategy](../percent-of-portfolio), however, it avoids
extreme year-over-year fluctuations that can result from withdrawing a direct
percent of your current portfolio value.

It does this through its namesake rule: the 95% Rule. The 95% Rule works like
this: each year you can either withdraw your Safe Withdrawal Rate (typically
around 4%) **or** 95% of your previous year's withdrawal.

What this means is that your withdrawal will only ever drop at most 95% from the
previous year, even if the market experiences a sudden and sharp decline. This
can smooth out particularly turbulent retirement periods, such as the 30 year
retirement from 1930 to 1959.

Keep in mind that although year-over-year withdrawal fluctuations are reduced
with the 95% Rule, there can still be substantial fluctuations in withdrawals
over the course of the entire retirement. Looking again at the 1930 to 1959
simulation: with an initial 4% withdrawal of
$40,000, the
smallest withdrawal is $20,083.01 while the largest is \$62,849.28.

### Strengths

- Never prematurely exhausts your portfolio
- Minimizes year-over-year withdrawal amount variability through its namesake
  rule

### Weaknesses

- Like all withdrawal strategies that vary based on market conditions, annual
  withdrawals can become too low without a minimum withdrawal in place.
