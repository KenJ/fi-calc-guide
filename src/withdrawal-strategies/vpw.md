# Variable Percentage Withdrawal (VPW)

The Variable Percentage Withdrawal (VPW) strategy was designed by the Bogleheads
community. It's an effort to fuse the three
["Basic Strategies"](../basic-strategies/) into one strategy that captures the
best parts of those strategies, while minimizing the bad parts.

As a Maximize Spending strategy, VPW will never prematurely deplete your
portfolio, but by design it brings your portfolio to \$0 in the final year of
your retirement.

### Strengths

- Adapts to market conditions, ensuring your portfolio never runs out of money
  prematurely
- Ensures that you spend as much money as possible during your retirement

### Weaknesses

- Withdrawal amounts can vary considerably based on market conditions
- Following the algorithm toward the end of your estimated retirement may create
  problems. We can never know how long we will actually live.
