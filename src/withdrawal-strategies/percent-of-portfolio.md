# Percent of Portfolio

The percent of portfolio withdrawal strategy allows you to spend a constant
percentage of your portfolio each year.

For example, you may choose to withdraw `4%` of whatever your portfolio is
valued at each year. If your portfolio starts at `$1,000,000`, then your first
year withdrawal will be `$40,000`. Later on, if your portfolio dips to
`$430,000`, your withdrawal for that year would be `$17,200`.

### Strengths

- Never prematurely runs out of money
- Spending is adjusted based on market conditions

### Weaknesses

- High year-over-year variability in your withdrawals. When the market does
  poorly, your annual withdrawal may be quite small. And likewise, your
  withdrawals may grow sharply when the market does well.
