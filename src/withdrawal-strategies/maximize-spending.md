# Maximize Spending

> Detailed guides for each of these withdrawal strategies are coming soon.

These strategies aim to maximize how much you spend over the course of your
retirement.

A common feature between these strategies is that they completely deplete your
portfolio in the final year of the specified retirement length, while also
guaranteeing that you never run out before that final year.

If leaving a sizable legacy behind is not a concern of yours, then these
strategies may appeal to you.
