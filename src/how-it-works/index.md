# How It Works

These guides explain the inner workings of this calculator. If you have a
question about the specific details of FI Calc's algorithms, then these guides
should provide those answers.

The pages in this section can at times be more technical.

## Pages in this Guide

- [One Simulation Year](/how-it-works/one-simulation-year): This guide explains
  the order of how things are computed in a given simulation year, such as when
  withdrawals are made and when fees are applied.

- [Historical Data Source](/how-it-works/historical-data-source): Learn about
  the source of data used for FI Calc's historical data simulations.

- [Computed Historical Data](/how-it-works/computed-historical-data): FI Calc
  must compute values from the historical data set before they can be used to
  run simulations. Learn what calculations are made here.
