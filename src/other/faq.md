# FAQ

These are general questions and answers about FI Calc and me, the creator.

## How Do I...?

### Enter real estate into FI Calc?

You can use the [Additional Income](/configuration/additional-income/) feature
of FI Calc to support real estate.

If you have a rental property, you can specify the annual cashflow as recurring
income for as long as you intend to own the home.

If you intend to sell the property, then you can add your earnings from the sell
as additional income in the year that you sell.

If there are more features you need to help manage your real estate investments,
please [let me know](/contact/).

## About the Creator

### Who created FI Calc?

My name is James. It's nice to meet you! I'm a designer and engineer in Silicon
Valley who is interested in early retirement.

### Are you retired?

Not yet! (as of April 2020)

### Do you have a favorite withdrawal strategy?

Honestly, it changes. I'm drawn to simple withdrawal strategies that you can
calculate on a piece of paper. Right now I like the Constant Dollar and
Endowment Strategy.

### What are your favorite early retirement blogs and resources?

I'm not particularly active in the FIRE community right now, but I listen to
[Paula Pant's podcast](https://affordanything.com) and read
[Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com).

## General Questions

### What's the business model of FI Calc?

FI Calc does not currently earn any revenue.

### Do you plan to monetize FI Calc?

There will always be a free version of FI Calc, and that free version will
always include every feature that doesn't require a database.

One feature that I've considered adding are user accounts, which would allow you
to save simulations. This feature requires a database, though, which would cost
me a little bit of money.

If I do add this feature, then I would want to at least cover the cost of the
database. The most likely turn of events is that I would introduce ads to FI
Calc.

I'm still not sure if I should add user accounts. Would you find them useful?

### When was FI Calc created?

### What technology is FI Calc built with?

FI Calc is a client-side React application. There is no server; all calculations
are performed in the browser.
