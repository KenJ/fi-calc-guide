# Exporting Results

The results page of FI Calc provides some analysis of the results of your
simulations. Sometimes, however, you may want to run additional analysis in a
spreadsheet application.

FI Calc allows you to export your results as a CSV file.

## Exporting Results

You can download a CSV file that combines all of the simulations in your
calculation, or a CSV file for an individual simulation.

### Exporting All Simulations as a CSV

Locate the "Download as CSV" button on the results page. Click it to download
the file.

### Exporting a Single Simulation as a CSV

First, navigate into an individual simulation. Then, locate the "Download as
CSV" button on the simulation results page. Click it to download the file.
