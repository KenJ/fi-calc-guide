# Saving Calculations

> This feature is an early preview. Read more at the bottom of this page.

Sometimes, you may wish to save or share a calculation. In FI Calc, you can do
this using shareable URLs.

## How to Get a Shareable URL

Locate the "Share Calculation" button on the Results page. Click it, and a
popover will appear with the URL. Press the "Copy" button to copy it to your
clipboard.

You can bookmark this URL to revisit past calculations.
